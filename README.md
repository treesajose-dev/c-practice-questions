# c-practice-questions

This repository contains a collection of simple C programs that I wrote for practice and learning purposes. 
The programs cover a range of fundamental topics such as loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and more. 
Each program is self-contained and aims to demonstrate a specific concept in C programming. 
Feel free to explore, use, and suggest improvements!
